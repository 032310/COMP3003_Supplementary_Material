List of packages (Standard Libraries) that has been included into the project are as follow:

Unity ML-Agent


* for the ease of use, all model training and inferencing procedures have been compiled under single file, namely Reinforcement Learning Model Training and Inferencing.ipynb. Hence, suggested way of running this project would be :

1. Setting up virtual environement for the project
2. Follow the prerequisite instruction inside the Reinforcement Learning Model Training and Inferencing.ipynb
3. Begin the model training/inferencing procedures.
*alternatives have also been provided inside the file in ocaasion where code running errors.
